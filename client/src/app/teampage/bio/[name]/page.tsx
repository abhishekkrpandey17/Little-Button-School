    bio: "At Little Buttons, we work closely with parents, because we believe learning is most powerful when school and home walk hand in hand. Your voice matters here, and your child will always be seen, heard, and celebrated.A warm welcome to Little Buttons! As both a mother and an educator with over 15 years of experience in childhood education, I understand the trust it takes to place your little one in someone else’s care. Having raised my own children as a single parent, I know firsthand how deeply we wish to give our children a nurturing, safe, and joyful start in life—and that’s exactly what we promise at Little Buttons.This preschool is not just a school to me—it’s a part of my heart. Every child who walks through our doors becomes part of a loving, extended family. I believe that early childhood is not simply a stepping stone to “real school,” but a precious stage that deserves all the care, attention, and celebration we can give. Here, children are allowed to be themselves—to wonder, to ask, to explore, and to bloom at their own pace",

Our curriculum is thoughtfully designed to balance academic readiness with life skills, creative expression, and values that reflect who we are as a society.",
